# Animal-Bot
I created a discord bot using discord.py to be able to enhance 
my python skills while also creating something fun to show my friends. 

1. Use of Beautiful Soup 4 for web scraping and finding info of the animals
2. Use of discord.py to create the bot and use on servers of friends.
3. Use of flask server to keep the bot able to run on the cloud.
4. UptimeRobot was used to allow for the bot to be pinged continuously as to not shut down. 

Some parts of the bot were set up following the tutorial by freecodecamp.org: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPTfmiYiuok&t=1308s
